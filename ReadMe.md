####This is a Python implementation of Coherent Moving Cluster algorithm.
####The origin algorithm is implemented By @se0kjun in Java.
####Run Test_Driver.py for testing.

####Inputs:
###### A set of trajectories
###### An integer m
###### A lifetime k
###### A distance threshold e

#### Output:
###### Set of groups of objects travelling together with respect to parameters m and e for at least k consectutive timestamps

#### Data (csv file) is provided in Ressource folder:
###### obj_id:object id
###### t: timestamp
###### x: x-coordinate of the object
##### y: y-coordinate of the objcet
